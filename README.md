# Snowman Game

![Snapshot of the Game](Snapshot%20of%20game.png)

## Project Overview

**Snowman** is an engaging word guessing game inspired by Hangman, designed for players of all ages. The game randomly selects a hidden word and allows the player to guess letters, with a limit of 8 lives. If a guessed letter appears in the word, it is revealed; if not, the player loses a life and part of the snowman melts. The objective is to guess the word before running out of lives. This game provides a fun and non-offensive alternative for younger players.
