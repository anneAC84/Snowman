                         Snowman Game

![alt text](image.png)



The name of my game is called Snowman. 

My game uses, HTML, CSS and Javascript programing to randomly select a hidden word and allow a player to guess letters with a limit of 8 lives.  If a guessed letter appears in the word, the letter is revealed, if not, the player loses a life and part of the snowman melts.  The goal of the game is to guess the word before running out of lives.

The snowman game is very similar to the hangman game and I chose this as an alternative to the hangman game this is to enable younger kids to enjoy the benefits of playing a word guessing game without it being offensive.
